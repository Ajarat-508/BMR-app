 BMR is the number of calories you burn when your body is resting. In other words, it's the number of calories your body needs to keep you going. 
 BMR is a hypothetical estimate of the amount of energy your body burns to maintain essential physiological functions. By knowing this BMR Rate value, they can factor in their workouts or activity and figure out how many calories they need per day to meet their weight loss goals.
  
  Mifflin-St Jeor formula to calculate their BMR:
Male BMR = (9.99 × weight [kg]) + (6.25 × height [cm]) − (4.92 × age [years]) + 5
Female BMR = (9.99 × weight [kg]) + (6.25 × height [cm]) − (4.92 × age [years]) − 161

Once BMR value is determined with the above formula, the following table will help you calculate your recommended daily intake to maintain your current weight. Daily kilocalories needed:

Little to no exercise: BMR × 1.2
Light workouts (1-3 days per week): BMR × 1.375
Moderate workouts (3-5 days per week): BMR × 1.55
Heavy workouts (6-7 days per week): BMR × 1.725
Very heavy workouts (twice per day, extra heavy workouts): BMR × 2
Depending upon the above calculation:

If you want to lose weight, you need to eat less energy than you burn over time.
If you want to gain weight, you need to eat slightly more energy than you burn over time.
If you want to maintain your current weight, you need to eat more or less the same amount of energy you burn over time.
